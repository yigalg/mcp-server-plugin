# MCP Server Plugin for Jenkins
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server Plugin for Jenkins implements the server-side component of the Model Context Protocol. This plugin enables Jenkins to act as an MCP server, providing context, tools, and capabilities to MCP clients, such as LLM-powered applications or IDEs.

## Features

- **MCP Server Implementation**: Implements the server-side of the Model Context Protocol.
- **Jenkins Integration**: Exposes Jenkins functionalities as MCP tools and resources.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Allows easy extension of MCP capabilities through the `McpServerExtension` interface.

## Key Components

1. **Endpoint**: The main entry point for MCP communication, handling MCP transport connections and message routing.
2. **DefaultMcpServer**: Implements `McpServerExtension`, providing default tools for interacting with Jenkins jobs and builds.
3. **McpToolWrapper**: Wraps Java methods as MCP tools, handling parameter parsing and result formatting.
4. **McpServerExtension**: Interface for extending MCP server capabilities.

## MCP SDK Version

This MCP Server is based on the MCP Java SDK version 0.17.2, which implements the MCP specification version 2025-06-18.

## Getting Started

### Configuration

The MCP Server plugin automatically sets up necessary endpoints and tools upon installation, requiring no additional configuration.

#### System properties

The following system properties can be used to configure the MCP Server plugin:

- hard limit on max number of log lines to return with `io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.extensions.BuildLogsExtension.limit.max=10000` (default 10000)
- disable stateless endpoint with `io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.disableMcpStateless=true` (default false)
- disable SSE endpoint with `io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.disableMcpSse=true` (default false)
- disable streamable HTTP endpoint with `io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.disableMcpStreamable=true` (default false)

#### Origin header validation

The MCP specification marks validating the `Origin` header of incoming requests as a `MUST`.

By default, when an `Origin` header is present it is validated against the configured Jenkins root URL
(`io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.requireOriginMatch` defaults to `true`). Requests that do not send
an `Origin` header are still allowed, so AI agents that omit it keep working
(`io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.requireOriginHeader` defaults to `false`).

- To also reject requests that omit the `Origin` header, set
  `io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.requireOriginHeader=true`.
- To disable Origin matching entirely (not recommended), set
  `io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.requireOriginMatch=false`.

### Connection Resilience

The MCP Server plugin includes several features to improve connection reliability.

The keep-alive and timeout tuning described below primarily concern the **SSE** transport (`/mcp-server/sse`), which holds a single long-lived server→client connection open and is therefore sensitive to idle timeouts in Jenkins, proxies, and load balancers. If you use **Streamable HTTP** (`/mcp-server/mcp`) with the usual request/response pattern, you are unlikely to need any of it (see [Transport Recommendation](#transport-recommendation)). The health, metrics, and graceful-shutdown features apply to all transports.

#### Keep-Alive Messages

For the **SSE** transport, the server sends periodic keep-alive pings over the open connection to detect broken connections and to stop idle timeouts (in Jenkins, proxies, or load balancers) from closing it. By default, pings are sent every 30 seconds.

You can configure this interval with the system property:
```
io.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.keepAliveInterval=30
```

Set to `0` to disable keep-alive messages (not recommended for SSE).

> [!NOTE]
> A ping is only delivered when there is an open server→client stream. SSE always has one. Streamable HTTP only has one while the client keeps a long-lived GET stream open; for a plain POST request/response client there is no stream to ping, so this setting has no effect.

#### Health Endpoint

A lightweight MCP-specific health endpoint is available for connection monitoring at:
```
<jenkins-url>/mcp-health
```

This endpoint:
- Returns MCP server status and active connection counts
- Requires no authentication for maximum accessibility
- Returns immediately without MCP protocol overhead
- Returns HTTP 200 when healthy, HTTP 503 during shutdown
- Includes `Retry-After` header during shutdown

Response format:
```json
{
  "mcpServerStatus": "ok",
  "activeConnections": 5,
  "shuttingDown": false,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-28T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Recommended client usage:**
- Poll the health endpoint periodically (e.g., every 10-30 seconds)
- When the endpoint returns 503 or becomes unreachable, prepare for reconnection
- Use the `Retry-After` header value when available

#### Metrics Endpoint

A metrics endpoint is available for monitoring connection statistics at:
```
<jenkins-url>/mcp-server/metrics
```

This endpoint requires authentication (standard Jenkins permissions) and provides:
```json
{
  "sseConnectionsTotal": 42,
  "sseConnectionsActive": 3,
  "streamableRequestsTotal": 150,
  "connectionErrorsTotal": 2,
  "uptimeSeconds": 3600,
  "startTime": "2025-01-28T10:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Graceful Shutdown

When Jenkins shuts down, the health endpoint will return `503 Service Unavailable` with a brief grace period before full termination. This allows clients to detect the shutdown and prepare for reconnection.

#### Transport Recommendation

For better connection reliability, we recommend using **Streamable HTTP** (`/mcp-server/mcp`) instead of **SSE** (`/mcp-server/sse`). Streamable HTTP handles connection issues more gracefully and is the preferred transport for most MCP clients.

#### Production Deployment

When deploying the **SSE** transport behind a reverse proxy or in production environments, configure the timeout settings below so the long-lived connection is not dropped prematurely. Streamable HTTP users generally don't need this (see the note at the end of this section).

**Jenkins/Jetty Configuration (SSE)**

Jenkins uses Winstone (embedded Jetty) which defaults `httpKeepAliveTimeout` to 30 seconds. Since MCP keep-alive pings are also sent every 30 seconds, this creates a race condition where Jetty may close the SSE connection before the next ping arrives.

Add this argument to your Jenkins startup command:
```
--httpKeepAliveTimeout=600000
```

For Docker deployments, add to your docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
    command: ["--httpKeepAliveTimeout=600000"]
```

**Reverse Proxy Configuration (Nginx)**

For Nginx, extend timeouts for the MCP endpoints. This keeps SSE connections from being closed while idle:
```nginx
location ~ ^/(mcp-server|mcp-health)/ {
    proxy_pass http://jenkins;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_request_buffering off;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header Connection "";
    proxy_read_timeout 600s;
    proxy_send_timeout 600s;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The one timeout that can also affect **Streamable HTTP** is `proxy_read_timeout`: a single long-running tool call (for example a slow `triggerBuild`) can exceed a short default and return `504 Gateway Timeout`. Raising `proxy_read_timeout` as shown above prevents that regardless of transport. The `httpKeepAliveTimeout` race condition above is SSE-only.

#### Transport Endpoints

The MCP Server plugin provides three transport endpoints, all enabled by default:

| Transport | Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **SSE** | `/mcp-server/sse` + `/mcp-server/message` | Server-Sent Events transport with session management |
| **Streamable HTTP** | `/mcp-server/mcp` | Streamable HTTP transport with session management |
| **Stateless** | `/mcp-server/stateless` | Stateless HTTP transport without session management |

Each transport can be disabled independently using system properties:

```
-Dio.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.disableMcpSse=true
-Dio.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.disableMcpStreamable=true
-Dio.jenkins.plugins.mcp.server.Endpoint.disableMcpStateless=true
```

##### When to use Stateless transport

The stateless endpoint (`/mcp-server/stateless`) is useful for:
- Simple deployments where session management overhead is not needed
- Environments where clients make independent requests without maintaining a persistent connection
- Testing and debugging scenarios
- Clients that don't support session-based protocols

## Usage

### Connecting to the MCP Server

MCP clients can connect to the server using:
- Streamable HTTP Endpoint: `<jenkins-url>/mcp-server/mcp`
- SSE Endpoint: `<jenkins-url>/mcp-server/sse`
- Message Endpoint: `<jenkins-url>/mcp-server/message`
- Stateless Endpoint: `<jenkins-url>/mcp-server/stateless`

### Authentication and Credentials

The MCP Server Plugin requires the same credentials as the Jenkins instance it's running on. To authenticate your MCP queries:

1. **Jenkins API Token**: Generate an API token from your Jenkins user account.
2. **Basic Authentication**: Use the API token in the HTTP Basic Authentication header.

#### Generate a personal access token
To generate a personal access token:

- Sign in to Jenkins.
- Select your user icon in the upper-right corner, and then select `Security`.
- Select `Add new token`.
- Enter a name to distinguish the token, and then select `Generate`.
- Copy the token and store it in a secure location for later use.

> [!WARNING] 
> Once you leave the page, you cannot view or copy the token again.

- Select `Done` to add the token.
- Select `Save` to save your changes.

#### Encode credentials for HTTP basic authentication

Use basic HTTP authentication with the MCP agent by encoding it with the personal access token.

To encode credentials on Linux, macOS, or Windows:

Open a terminal and run the following command, replacing `<username>` and `<token>` with your actual username and the personal access token you generated in Jenkins

- Linux or macOS
```bash
echo -n "<username>:<token>" | base64
```
- Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("<username>:<token>"))
```

if successful, the Base64-encoded credential is output, similar to the following:

```bash
dXNlcm5hbWU6dG9rZW4=
```

Store the encoded credential in a secure location for later use.

> [!NOTE] 
> Base64 encoding is not encryption.
> Anyone with access to the encoded string can decode it and obtain your credentials.
> Always protect the encoded credentials as if they are the original username and token.

### Example Client Configurations
#### Cline Configuration 
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jenkins": {
      "autoApprove": [
        
      ],

      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Copilot Configuration
Copilot doesn't work well with the Streamable transport as of now, and I'm still investigating the issues. Please continue to use the SSE endpoint.
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "jenkins": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "https://jenkins-host/mcp-server/sse",

          "Authorization": "Basic <user:token base64>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Streamable example:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "jenkins": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://jenkins-host/mcp-server/mcp",

### Available Tools

The plugin provides the following built-in tools for interacting with Jenkins:

#### Job Management
- `createPipeline`: Create a new Jenkins pipeline job. Required parameters: `jobName` (name or full path of the pipeline) and `pipelineScript` (Jenkins pipeline script). If a job with the provided name already exists, an error is returned.
- `getJob`: Get a Jenkins job by its full path.
- `getJobs`: Get a paginated list of Jenkins jobs, sorted by name.
- `triggerBuild`: Trigger a build of a job.
  This tool supports parameterized builds. You can provide parameters as a JSON object where each key is the parameter name. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "jobFullName": "my-job",
    "parameters": {
      "BRANCH": "main",
      "DEBUG_MODE": "true"
    }
  }
  ```
  Note on Parameters:
  - **Core Jenkins Parameters**: Fully supported (String, Boolean, Choice, Text, Password, Run)
  - **Plugin Parameters**: Automatically detected and handled using reflection
  - **File Parameters**: Not supported via MCP (require file uploads)
  - **Multi-select Parameters**: Supported as arrays or lists
  - **Custom Plugin Parameters**: Automatically attempted using reflection-based detection
  - **Fallback Behavior**: Unsupported parameters fall back to default values with logging
  This tool returns a queue item if the job is successfully scheduled. You can use the returned queue item ID with the `getQueueItem` tool.

- `getQueueItem`: Get information about a queued item using its ID.

#### Build Information
- `getBuild`: Retrieve a specific build or the last build of a Jenkins job.
- `updateBuild`: Update build display name and/or description.
- `getBuildLog`: Retrieve log lines with pagination for a specific build or the last build. Supports forward reads, end-relative reads (negative `skip`/`limit`), and cursor pagination: every response carries a `nextCursor` you can pass back as `cursor` to keep reading without re-scanning from the top. The cursor is tied to the `(job, buildNumber)` it was issued for and is rejected if used against a different build. `totalLines` is exact for end-relative reads and `-1` for forward/cursor reads (which stop as soon as they have enough lines, so the total is never computed). Reads a non-blocking snapshot, so it returns promptly even while a build is still running. If `nextCursor` is set but `hasMoreContent` is false, you've read everything written so far and the build is still going; hold onto the cursor and call again later to pick up whatever was appended in between.
- `searchBuildLog`: Search for log lines matching a pattern (string or regex) in build logs. Reads a non-blocking snapshot (returns promptly for in-progress builds) and stops scanning early once `maxMatches` is reached.
- `rebuildBuild`: Re-run a build with the same parameters. For Pipeline jobs with Replay support, uses the original script; for other parameterized jobs, schedules a new build with the same parameters. Optional `buildNumber`; defaults to the last build. Returns the queue item for the new build.
- `getReplayScripts`: Return the main script and loaded scripts of a replayable Pipeline build. Use this to inspect or modify script before calling `replayBuild`. Fails for non-Pipeline jobs. Optional `buildNumber`; defaults to the last build.
- `replayBuild`: Run a Pipeline build again with a modified script. Provide `mainScript` (required) and optionally `loadedScripts`. Optional `buildNumber`; defaults to the last build. Fails if the build is not replayable or replay is not allowed (e.g. permissions or sandbox).
- `getTestResults`: Retrieve test results of a specific build or the last build.

#### SCM Integration
- `getJobScm`: Retrieve SCM configurations of a Jenkins job.
- `getBuildScm`: Retrieve SCM configurations of a specific build.
- `getBuildChangeSets`: Retrieve change log sets of a specific build.
- `findJobsWithScmUrl`: Find jobs using a specific SCM (git) repository URL

#### Management Information
- `whoAmI`: Get information about the current user.
- `getStatus`: Checks the health and readiness status of a Jenkins instance. Use this tool to assess Jenkins instance health rather than simple up/down status.



Each tool accepts specific parameters to customize its behavior. For detailed usage instructions and parameter descriptions, refer to the API documentation or use the MCP introspection capabilities.

To use these tools, connect to the MCP server endpoint and make tool calls using your MCP client implementation.

{
  "jobFullName": "my-parameterized-job",
  "parameters": {
    "BRANCH": "main",
    "DEBUG_MODE": true,
    "ENVIRONMENT": "production",
    "FEATURES": ["feature1", "feature2"],
    "NOTES": "Build triggered via MCP"
  }
}
```

### Extending MCP Capabilities

To add new MCP tools or functionalities:

1. Create a class implementing `McpServerExtension`.
2. Use `@Tool` to expose methods as MCP tools.
3. Use `@ToolParam` to define and describe tool parameters.

Example:

```java
@Extension
public class MyCustomMcpExtension implements McpServerExtension {
	@Tool(description = "My custom tool")
	public String myCustomTool(@ToolParam(description = "Input parameter") String input) {
		// Tool implementation
	}
}
```

### Overriding a Built-in Tool

You can replace a built-in tool (or any tool contributed by another plugin) with your own
implementation from a separate plugin. Declare a `@Tool` with the **same name** and set
`override = true`:

```java
@Extension
public class MyBuildLogExtension implements McpServerExtension {
	@Tool(name = "getBuildLog", description = "My own getBuildLog", override = true)
	public MyResponse getBuildLog(@ToolParam(description = "Job full name") String jobFullName) {
		// Your implementation replaces the built-in getBuildLog
	}
}
```

Rules:

- Overriding is an explicit opt-in. A tool only replaces another tool of the same name when it sets
  `override = true`. This guarantees a built-in tool is never silently shadowed by an accidental name
  clash.
- If two tools share a name and **none** of them sets `override = true`, the existing (built-in) tool
  is kept and the duplicate is skipped with a warning in the logs.
- The `@Extension(ordinal = ...)` value is only used to break ties when **several** tools declare
  `override = true` for the same name: the one provided by the extension with the highest ordinal
  wins.
- Each tool name is exposed exactly once, so MCP clients always see a single `getBuildLog`.

### Result Handling

The MCP Server Plugin handles various result types with the following approach:

- **List Results**: Each element in the list is converted to a separate text content item in the response.
- **Single Objects**: The entire object is converted into a single text content item.

For serialization to text content:

- **@ExportedBean Annotation**: If the result object is annotated with `@ExportedBean` (from `org.kohsuke.stapler.export`), Jenkins' `org.kohsuke.stapler.export.Flavor.JSON` exporting mechanism is used.
- **Other Objects**: For objects without the `@ExportedBean` annotation, Jackson is used for JSON serialization.

This approach ensures flexible and efficient handling of different result types, accommodating both Jenkins-specific exported objects and standard Java objects.
This flexible approach ensures that tool results are consistently and accurately represented in the MCP response, regardless of their complexity.
### Integration with GitHub Copilot
The MCP Server Plugin seamlessly integrates with GitHub Copilot, enhancing your development experience by providing direct access to Jenkins information within your IDE. This integration allows you to interact with Jenkins jobs and builds using natural language queries.
![GitHub Copilot Integration](doc/copilot.png)

As shown in the screenshot:
1. You can ask Copilot about Jenkins jobs using natural language, e.g., "list jenkins job under root".
2. Copilot uses the MCP Server to fetch and display information about Jenkins jobs, listing the jobs under the root directory.
3. You can also request specific information, such as "get the last build status of job a", and Copilot will provide the relevant details including build number, status, and URL.

This integration streamlines your workflow by allowing you to access Jenkins information without leaving your development environment.
